# Abstract
**Background & Objectives:**

Delirium is associated with longitudinal decline in cognition. We utilised neuroimaging to examine longitudinal changes in brain structure, in the presence and absence of amyloid plaque deposition, for individuals with historic delirium.

**Methods:**

Serial volumetric MRI and amyloid PET scans were conducted on 326 individuals enrolled in the Insight 46 neuroimaging study, who did not have a major brain disorder (including dementia). Linear regression was used to examine associations between delirium and rate of brain atrophy between scans, and further adjusted for the presence of amyloid plaques at baseline.

**Results:**

Delirium was associated with an increased rate of total brain atrophy (0.09% increased volume loss per year, 95% C.I. 0.01% to 0.17%, p=0.028) and an increase rate of ventricular expansion (0.80% increased expansion per year, 95% C.I. 0.09% to 1.51%, p=0.027). These associations were independent of amyloid, which had an increased association with hippocampal atrophy (0.13% volume loss per year, 95% C.I. 0.02% to 0.23%, p=0.019) not replicated in those with delirium. 

**Discussion:**

Delirium has long been associated with a higher risk of later life dementia. Links between delirium and increased rates of brain atrophy, independent of amyloid related atrophy, may highlight pre-clinical changes in brain structure related to prodromal dementia. However, given participants in our study had not developed dementia two years after their initial scan and had no demonstrable differences in Pre-clinical Alzheimerâ€™s Cognitive Composite scores, there is also a possibility our findings instead suggest a delirium specific mechanism for atrophy, independent of dementia.
